# wallpapers

This is a dotmodule intended to use with
[pont](https://github.com/alexaegis/pont)
and is also included in my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/AlexAegis/dotfiles)

## Storage

To save space in the repository there is
a [script here](./truncate_history.sh) that
will create a new commit of the working
tree and removes everything else.
